## React Fundamental Concepts Used
This project utilizes the following fundamental React concepts:

1. **Functional Components**: The main structure of the app is built using React functional components.
2. **State Management**: Using React's `useState` hook to manage the internal state of components.
3. **Props**: Passing data and functions between components using props.
4. **Event Handling**: Handling user actions such as button clicks and form submissions.
5. **Conditional Rendering**: Rendering different UI elements based on the state.
6. **useEffect Hook**: Used to perform side effects like fetching data or updating the document title.
7. **useContext Hook**: Using context API to manage global state across the app.
8. **useParams and useLoaderData**: Fetching and rendering dynamic data based on the URL using React Router.

## Data Handling and Management
In this project, the following methods are used to handle and manage data:

- **Context API**: We use the `useContext` hook for global state management to share data across multiple components, such as handling the cart and wishlist data.
- **Local Storage**: Data such as cart and wishlist items are stored in the browserâ€™s local storage to persist across page reloads.

## 5 Features of the Website/Project

1. **Product Listing**: Displays a list of products with details like title, price, image, and availability.
2. **Product Details Page**: When a user clicks on a product, a detailed page is shown, including product description, specifications, and ratings.
3. **Add to Cart**: Users can add products to their cart, and their selections are displayed in the cart summary. 
4. **Wishlist**: Users can add products to a wishlist for later purchase, keeping track of their desired items.
5. **Responsive Design**: The application is responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile views, providing a seamless user experience across devices.
